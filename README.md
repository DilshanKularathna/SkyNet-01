# SkyNet-01 -> Calculator using Jac

Welcome to the official repository of **SkyNet-01**, a team submission for Assignment Jac in 5 minites. This repository demonstrates our work with the Jac programming language, focusing on AI based Calculations.

### ✅ Step 05 – Basic Arithmetic Calculator

In this step, we implemented a basic calculator using Jac. The user is prompted to input two numbers and an arithmetic operation (such as `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`). Based on the operation selected, the program performs the appropriate calculation and displays the result. We used different nodes and walker logic to handle each operation modularly.

### ✅ Step 06 – LLM Integration with MTLLM

In this step, we enhanced the calculator by integrating a language model using the `mtllm` module. Instead of entering two numbers and an operator separately, the user can now input a full mathematical expression as a string (e.g., `2 + 2`). The LLM parses and evaluates the expression, returning the result. This approach makes the calculator more flexible and user-friendly.

These implementations highlight our progression from procedural computation to AI-assisted interaction.
